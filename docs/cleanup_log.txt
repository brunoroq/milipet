2025-11-12 Image Validation System
Added robust validation for product images (external HTTPS + local files):
- Created app/helpers/validation.php (~90 lines)
  - is_https_url(), is_http_url(), looks_like_image_filename()
  - head_content_type_and_length() - cURL HEAD request with fallback
  - is_valid_external_image_url() - validates HTTPS URLs, rejects HTTP and Google redirects
  - is_valid_local_image_path() - validates local files with getimagesize()
  - validate_product_image() - main validation entry point
- Updated public/index.php to load validation helper
- Updated AdminController::saveProduct() to validate image URLs before saving
  - Validates external HTTPS URLs (200/206 response, image/* content-type)
  - Validates local image files (existence + valid image format)
  - Rejects HTTP URLs (mixed content prevention)
  - Rejects Google redirect URLs
  - Shows validation errors with flash messages
  - Preserves form data on validation failure
- Updated app/views/admin/products.php
  - Added client-side validation hints (non-blocking)
  - Auto-repopulates form fields on validation errors
  - Visual feedback for invalid URLs (warning/error/success states)
- Created test_validation.php for testing validation functions
Net change: ~110 lines added
